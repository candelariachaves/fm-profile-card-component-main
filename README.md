##General
My challenge is to build out this profile card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I have to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. I will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This means that I'll need to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train my eyes to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.
